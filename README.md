This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of
enemies controlled by the computer.

Main.kt provides a test for all the functions in Final Reality yet, such as create and equip weapons
, create characters and enemies with their respective equals, tostring, and waitTurn test.

Characters and enemies cannot fight yet, but it can be created and weapons can be equipped to 
characters.

Brute class created, this class only can use swords and axes

Style changes all over the code

Weapon implementation changed to have an abstract class which extends to every type of weapon
